	<div id="bio">
		<p>Naol is a multi-hypen... scratch that.</p>
		<p>Hello there! Thanks for taking the time to stop by my website. We've most likely never met and that's okay,
			but
			I just hope you're doing well :)
		</p>
		<p> A little about me: I graduated from the University of Guelph with a degree in Philosophy; I'm currently
			working on Sereen, a peer-to-peer support network app, and FTWS, a digital publication spotlighting creatives.</p>
		<p>
			Throughout my career, I've worked on startups ranging from an AI Fitness + Nutrition App to a Character
			Assessment Tool for High School Football Athletes, sales roles for Neo Financial and BAY Specialized Tax
			Services, sports journalism for PRSVRE and NFL Draft Diamonds, sports sponsorships for SponsorUnited,
			football
			recruiting for The University of British Columbia and the US Navy, and a role as an Advisory Council Member
			for
			the National Youth Advisory Council under Mood Disorders Society of Canada.
		</p>
		<p> I also work on music from time to time, my entire discography was done by me from production to singing in
			my
			kitchen... haha. I was featured on CBC Radio 1, PopCanRadio, Ones To Watch, CanadianBeats + Zach's Picks of
			the
			Week, BuzzMusic, etc. I am also a part of a duo I founded
			called
			<a href="https://instagram.com/noctuse" target="_blank">Noctuse</a>, in which I am the vocalist and
			songwriter.
		</p>
		<p> Before all of those exciting things, I was a highly touted football athlete that was recruited from schools
			in
			Canada and the US. I won two football championships within my high school career, one with my school as a
			captain and another (Provincial/State) representing Guelph for the Jr. Gryphons.</p>
		<p> I'm very thankful and fortunate for all of my experiences as they have all tailored me into the person I am
			today. As I continue my journey working on my projects and music, I hope to continue to inspire
			and push
			civilization forward positively and with a smile :)</p>
