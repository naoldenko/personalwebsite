		<p>Naol is a multi-hypen... scratch that.</p>
		<p>Hello there! Thanks for taking the time to stop by my website. We've most likely never met and that's okay,
			but
			I just hope you're doing well :)
		</p>
		<p> I'm the Co-Founder & CEO of <a href="https://sereenminds.com">Sereen Health</a>, an anonymous peer-to-peer
			support network for musicians to
			discuss
			their mental health challenges/concerns. In addition to my mental health initiative, I am managing talent
			with
			my management agency - <a href="https://sereenminds.com">The Denko Agency</a>; I currently represent
			Veronica, a multi-faceted content creator
			with
			over 53,000 followers on TikTok, and a talented lo-fi producer called "moat" who has 40,000+ monthly
			listeners
			on Spotify.</p>
		<p>
			Throughout my career, I've worked on startups ranging from an AI Fitness + Nutrition App to a Character
			Assessment Tool for High School Football Athletes, sales roles for Neo Financial and BAY Specialized Tax
			Services, sports journalism for PRSVRE and NFL Draft Diamonds, sports sponsorships for SponsorUnited,
			football
			recruiting for The University of British Columbia and the US Navy, and a role as an Advisory Council Member
			for
			the National Youth Advisory Council under Mood Disorders Society of Canada.
		</p>
		<p> I also work on music from time to time, my entire discography was done by me from production to singing in
			my
			kitchen... haha. I was featured on CBC Radio 1, PopCanRadio, Ones To Watch, CanadianBeats + Zach's Picks of
			the
			Week, BuzzMusic, etc. All this hard work got noticed by the Head of Marketing Strategy at Canadian Country
			Music
			Association (Keith Buggy) who also conducted marketing for Burna Boy, Jhene Aiko, Omah Lay, and others from
			a
			previous marketing job, to manage me as an artist manager.</p>
		<p> Before all of those exciting things, I was a highly touted football athlete that was recruited from schools
			in
			Canada and the US. I won two football championships within my high school career, one with my school as a
			captain and another (Provincial/State) representing Guelph for the Jr. Gryphons.</p>
		<p> I'm very thankful and fortunate for all of my experiences as they have all tailored me into the person I am
			today. As I continue my journey working on Sereen, TDA, and my music, I hope to continue to inspire and push
			civilization forward positively and with a smile :)</p>
