	<div id="bio">
		<p>Naol is a multi-hypen... scratch that.</p>
		<p>Hello there! Thanks for taking the time to stop by my website. We've most likely never met and that's okay,
			but
			I just hope you're doing well :)
		</p>
		<p> A little about me: I graduated from the University of Guelph with a degree in Philosophy and an MBA
			candidate at Thompson Rivers University. I'm currently working at Grail Talent as an Influencer Talent Manager, and
			spotlighting creatives through a digital
			publication called FTWS.</p>
		<p>
			Throughout my career, I've worked on multiple startups ranging from an AI Fitness + Nutrition App to a
			Peer-to-Peer Support Network App, sports journalism for PRSVRE and NFL Draft Diamonds,
			sports sponsorships for SponsorUnited,
			football
			recruiting for The University of British Columbia, and a role as an Advisory Council Member + Bloom Blog
			Project Lead
			for
			the National Youth Advisory Council under Mood Disorders Society of Canada.
		</p>
		<p> Before all of those exciting things, I was a highly touted football athlete that was recruited from schools
			in
			Canada and the US. I won two football championships within my high school career, one with my school as a
			captain and another (Provincial/State) representing Guelph for the Jr. Gryphons.</p>
		<p> I'm very thankful and fortunate for all of my experiences as they have all tailored me into the person I am
			today. As I continue my journey, I hope to continue to inspire
			and push
			civilization forward positively and with a smile :)</p>
