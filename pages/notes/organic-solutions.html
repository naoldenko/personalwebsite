        <h1>Organic Solution</h1>
        <h3>September 2024</h3>
        <p>What I've learned in my startup journey is that you need to fall in love with the end user before working on the problem you're trying to solve.</p>
        <p>It sounds weird at first glance but think about it.</p>
        <p>If you glamorize the end users and put them on a pedestal, you have a North Star to rely on and have an intrinsic "user-centred" approach from Day 1.</p>
        <p>For instance, Sereen Health focuses on musicians' mental health by providing a peer-to-peer support network to discuss their challenges. I resonate with this as I am a musician and was challenged by the highs and lows of my career.</p>
        <p>I've delved into music communities way before I discovered the problem and held a grasp of what it's like to be a part of something.</p>
        <p>This is key.</p>
        <p>You need to be a part of those communities or wherever your end users are, not only for market research but to dive in and let them lead you as your North Star.</p>
        <p>This will lead the problem you're trying to solve into finding a possible organic solution.</p>
        <p>Identifying problems is good, but organic solutions are what I think are important.</p>
        <p>Those organic solutions may either appear complex, rudimentary, or horrible.</p>
        <p>Airbnb seemed like it wouldn't work initially; they would be classified as "horrible" to VCs back in the day. But, it was an organic solution that they identified to a problem THEY faced (founders were the initial end users) and someone taking a chance on them that led to their success.</p>
        <p>Obviously, other underlying factors come to play such as the team's competence, etc.</p>
        <p>However, the principle is that it's the authenticity of the problem-solution fit that matters the most and will ultimately dictate how far you'll go.</p>
