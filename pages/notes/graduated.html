        <p>Man, what a ride.</p>

        <p>I've received my final grades for the semester and have officially graduated from the University of Guelph with a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy and Honours academic standing.</p>
        
        <p>My post-secondary education did not start here, though.</p>
        
        <p>You see, I was originally supposed to go to the <a href="https://varsityblues.ca/news/2016/11/18/football-blues-announce-first-seven-signings-of-2017.aspx" target="_blank">University of Toronto</a> to play football, but due to depression and my grades declining, I decided not to pursue the school anymore.</p>
        
        <p>Now, I had nowhere to go and was contacting all the coaches I knew to see if they were recruiting any defensive backs (my position).</p>
        
        <p>I received an offer from the University of British Columbia with a little athletic scholarship. I got in contact with Saint Mary's University, and that led to me signing with them with a decent $3,500+ athletic scholarship.</p>
        
        <p>However, my stay at Saint Mary's was short-lived, as I experienced a depressive/suicidal episode, which led me to choose to leave the school, although the coaches suggested that I should not leave.</p>
        
        <p>I came back home devastated, and for two months, I did nothing but get food delivery and watch endless movies and TV shows in my bedroom.</p>
        
        <p>I was planning to go to the University of Calgary to play football after getting accepted and speaking to the head coach at the time.</p>
        
        <p>Yet, that was short-lived once again, after my psychiatrist said it was better to stay close to home.</p>
        
        <p>So, I stayed near home and attended Sheridan College. I initially studied Chemical Engineering Technology, but eventually switched to Software Development and Network Engineering, in which I finished my first semester with a 3.7 GPA.</p>
        
        <p>Then, I realized that I wanted to go back to university, so I transferred to the University of Guelph and was elated.</p>
        
        <p>Due to my father previously being a professor there in the Computer Science Faculty before he passed away, I had most of my tuition covered, so that relieved me from all the unnecessary stress of paying for school.</p>
        
        <p>I got in as an Economics major, initially, but later switched to English, and then finally Philosophy.</p>
        
        <p>Now, I'm here.</p>
        
        <p>However, there were a lot of challenges that I didn't mention, like the times when I didn't want to live anymore and got hospitalized, the constant school dropouts despite being in good academic standing, etc.</p>
        
        <p>Despite the bad, there was also a lot of good: I won three hackathon awards, got accepted to YSpace & Rise, got featured on the radio for music various times, founded startups which sparked my entrepreneurial journey, etc.</p>
        
        <p>But, I am honestly only here through faith and belief that there is hope for another tomorrow.</p>
        
        <p>That resilience and persistence were deeply rooted in my veins and kept me living for an additional day.</p>
        
        <p>Yet, it wasn't all me, it was thanks to my Mom.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you, Mom.</p>
        
        <p>This is for you,</p>
        
        <p>And Dad, I miss you.</p>
        
        <p>But, thank you for marrying this special woman.</p>
        
        <p>I wouldn't be here today without her ❤️</p>
