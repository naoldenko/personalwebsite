    <h1>Stupidity</h1>
    <h3>April 2025</h3>
    <div id="text">
        <p>I strongly believe that what precedes achieving success in life is to...</p>

        <p>Look stupid.</p>
        
        <p>Completely, absolutely, ferociously stupid.</p>
        
        <p>However, I'm not saying being a complete idiot will reap rewards.</p>
        
        <p>I'm talking about the calculated risks or leaps of faith that have been done multiple times throughout generations.</p>
        
        <p>This may seem utterly idiotic to others, but think about it...</p>
        
        <p>The Wright Brothers barely had any education on aviation, but what did they do?</p>
        
        <p>Picasso created MULTIPLE (tens of thousands) art pieces before he became well-known.</p>
        
        <p>It took me writing 100s of songs/demos before getting featured on CBC Radio 1, for my first song on my debut EP that I produced & engineered, while recording everything in my kitchen & bedroom.</p>
        
        <p>People doubted me, saying I should do this or do that instead, but I kept going, looking ferociously "stupid" with my ambitions.</p>
        
        <p>That is why you need to look stupid, initially, to really achieve what you want in life.</p>
        
        <p>If being "smart" feels better for you, so be it.</p>
        
        <p>But, if you want some excitement...</p>
        
        <p>Seek stupidity.</p>
