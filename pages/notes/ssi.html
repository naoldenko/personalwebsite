        <p>Long-term planning is speculative.</p>

        <p>It is good to think ahead, but changes are inevitable.</p>
        
        <p>I've learned firsthand with my numerous, meticulously crafted plans that ended up in a metaphorical trash bin.</p>
        
        <p>Adopting super-specific, immediate goals with a desired outcome is better.</p>
        
        <p>By having those super-specific, immediate goals with a desired outcome, you'll be able to have more clarity on what you want to achieve.</p>
        
        <p>Multiple SSI goals instead of lengthy, long-term plans will keep things running in motion, similar to ticking boxes off a to-do list.</p>
        
        <p>Implementing SSI goals can make life seem less Waterfall-like and more malleable/Agile-like.</p>
        
        <p>The utility of this is more freedom in approaching your life and having control without being chained to a long-term plan.</p>
        
        <p>Obviously, context matters.</p>
        
        <p>Yet, I believe this methodology of thinking will alleviate a lot of stress and ensure overall life satisfaction will improve.</p>
