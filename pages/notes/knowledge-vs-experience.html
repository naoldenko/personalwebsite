	<h1>Knowledge vs. Experience</h1>
	<h3>March 2025</h3>
	<div id="text">
        <p>In the beginning, I thought knowledge trumped experience.</p>
       
		<p>I was always in awe of people with prestigious degrees and academic backgrounds.</p>
        
		<p>However, as time passed, I realized that experience matters more.</p>
        
		<p>For instance, imagine playing a sport.</p>
        
		<p>Would the person who studied the game do better than someone with years of experience?</p>
        
		<p>I'll leave it to your interpretation.</p>
        
		<p>But, experience connects dots that lead to new knowledge acquisition that is intrinsic, whereas, knowledge is what you digest from loads of info that unfortunately means nothing UNLESS it's acted upon, thus leading to experience gained.</p>
        
		<p>Therefore, what do you think?</p>
        
		<p>Is knowledge more important than experience, and vice versa?</p>
        
		<p>Imagine hiring a person with an impressive academic background vs someone with extensive experience.</p>
        
		<p>What would you do?</p>
