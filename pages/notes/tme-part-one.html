        <h1>The Manic Entrepreneur | Part 1: Mental Health</h1>
        <h3>September 2024</h3>
        <p>Today is September 1st. Four more days before I head to my final year at the University of Guelph. If you’re
            not an Ontarian, you’re probably unfamiliar with the school. It’s a mid-sized institution with no law or
            medical school, but we do have a vet school, and it’s #1 in Canada, as well as our food sciences program.
            UofG is more science-oriented but I never signed up for that. Instead, I’m finishing up my degree in
            Philosophy, but I never started with that. Believe it or not, I never wanted to study philosophy at
            university after nearly passing a course in high school. I always wanted to study engineering since I was a
            kid when my father was alive and a comic artist as well (which I actually said at my dad’s funeral). As time
            went on, aspirations changed, experiences were felt, and the trajectory of my life went haywire. Mental
            illness came knocking. As a kid growing up, people always referred to others with mental illnesses as
            “crazy” or “insane,” which people in today’s age still say. It’s disheartening because now I’m considering
            those things. I’m not going to lie and say my life was decent, it was an immense mess that I still have to
            live up to. All of the relationships I’ve torn up and mistakes I’ve made, made me feel like my life was not
            worth living. As someone diagnosed with Type-1 Bipolar, life is excruciatingly unpredictable and challenging
            and managing the highs and lows of it is almost impossible. I’ve grown to understand that people go through
            similar challenges like myself. I was fortunate to meet people such as my friend Veronica who experiences
            Type-1 Bipolar as well too. Mental illness will always be a difficult thing to convey to others and you
            always fear embarrassment and the stigma associated with it. It’s frustrating having to deal with people who
            are ignorant about the matter and treat you less because of that. When will we ever treat mental illness
            similarly to physical illnesses people go through? That’s a common question I’ve heard numerous times as
            life went on when I got diagnosed. The constant fear of people judging me and my illness especially as an
            athlete, musician, and entrepreneur, is something I continuously experienced. I’ve lost opportunities as an
            athlete from having to de-commit from the University of Toronto’s Football Program due to the decline of my
            grades in my senior year of high school to losing interest from several Division 1 football programs. I was
            fortunate to get accepted to one school: Saint Mary’s University. The Head Football Coach at the time, James
            Colzie III, took me in. Thanks to the Defensive Backs Coach, Brandon Dubs, who was a former coach at Mount
            Allison University, where the former Head Football Coach there, Scott Brady, visited me and my mom back in
            High School in my Grade 11/Junior Year. I was glad the school accepted me and that the Head Football Coach
            who is also the Cornerbacks Coach (my position) was a former Florida State Seminole and won a BCS National
            Champion. Yet, I wasn’t prepared, my medications and eating habits due to them made me gain a ton of weight
            which obviously wouldn’t be transferable to my position in football. I left for Saint Mary’s in August 2017
            for Training Camp. I was excited but anxious. I wasn’t sure if I was going to be good compared to other
            players and worried about the stressors of academics. However, I was ready to go regardless. Training Camp
            came and it was gruelling. The constant practice in hot weather, meetings, meals, etc. It was an interesting
            experience, as I’ve never felt like I was a part of something bigger, such as partaking in a football
            program. I learned a ton about camaraderie, working as a team, active listening, taking initiative, and
            effort were all skills that were vital to the success of a group. Most people from sports backgrounds
            understand how important their experience in organized sports is in shaping their perspective in the
            workforce and how it was for the betterment of their careers. I’ve recognized this now as I reflect in
            retrospect. Despite the learnings, I felt depressed. It wasn’t the football program, coaches, teammates, or
            the school, but rather how I felt about myself. I felt like I was a joke. This led to me hearing voices
            which altered my state of mind that to my suicide attempt. I remember vividly crying in a bathroom taking a
            bunch of pills from my Prozac and Abilify bottles. I wanted to end my life. I contacted my Head Football
            Coach and told him how I felt and fell asleep. He eventually contacted my teammates and he came himself as
            well. I was in a really bad state of mind. I was devastated. I was taken to the hospital in an ambulance and
            arrived there for blood tests and assessment. There was nothing wrong with me, I was all fine. So, they gave
            me a voucher and I headed back to my dorm. As I headed back to my dorm, I took a break from practices and
            school. I just stayed in my dorm and did nothing. I eventually decided to go back home and notified the Head
            Football Coach. We had a meeting and we chatted. There was one thing he mentioned that stuck with me to this
            day; the idea that staying at home will lead you to being idle. After seven years of him saying that, I’m
            glad I can say that I didn’t remain idle and in fact worked hard. I worked on multiple projects with various
            people from different backgrounds, won 3 hackathon awards from 2 of them, been featured on CBC Radio
            1/PopCanRadio/Ones To Watch for my music, been accepted to entrepreneurship programs, became a published
            sports writer, etc. I’ve grown a lot ever since I left the university and I think the underlying factor was
            the word “idle.” Idleness is something we don’t want in our partners or children but is something we
            indubitably need to abhor. I continued to work hard, but through the hard work, I lost my sanity. Before I
            got my bipolar treatment, my initial diagnosis was depression and psychosis. I took antidepressants (Prozac)
            and antipsychotics (Abilify). Those were the same meds I overdosed with at Saint Mary’s University. Being
            medicated during high school was tough. I gained a lot of weight which affected my performance on the
            football field, but I thought to myself that it was better to be happy than depressed. I still remember
            during Team Ontario tryouts I started bashing my head on a goal post and had a crying spell due to the
            constant hearing of voices and assuming coaches and players were saying things about me. After tryouts, I
            was so embarrassed, but went out to eat a burger with my friend who came with me and eventually made the
            team and Team Canada as well. Another lost opportunity. I remember during football practice at my high
            school I put a t-shirt on top of my head and tried to be a clown or when I was in my Biology class in Grade
            12 and disrupted the class and jumped up when I saw a spider dangling on a web. I definitely did not have
            depression and psychosis. There was something wrong was me and I never found out the issue until 2018.
            That’s when I was diagnosed with Type-1 Bipolar. That dramatically altered my mind and how I perceived
            myself on a day-to-day basis. When I got diagnosed I felt another side of me being shown that I’ve never
            experienced before. A sense of knowing and not knowing I am unaware. The journey I would have to go through
            in my life with an acknowledged mental illness, which was far better than going undiagnosed, but the
            medication, therapy, talks with friends and family, etc. I never thought I would’ve been in this situation
            and took me a while to feel empowered and inspire others with their challenges in their lives as well.
            Growing up I wasn’t aware too much of mental illness and getting a diagnosis with one was still something I
            had to get used to. Luckily, initiatives are set in place in now with tons of organizations prioritizing
            mental health, however, we still fall short. The stigma is out there. Present. More work is required to
            dismantle the barriers for those who experience difficulties with their mental health. More care towards
            others, providing immense support for their challenges and nurturing their development and growth as a
            member of society. In high school, I talked to a few teachers about my mental health struggles. My Grade 11
            & 12 English teachers and Grade 11 & 12 Computer Science teacher. I spoke to my Grade 11 teacher after my
            exam and expressed how was experiencing a lot of depression. He suggested I should write or journal to
            alleviate my emotions. My Computer Science teacher loosely suggested the same thing too and also mentioned
            writing as a way to help yourself. This led me to write poetry for once. I was terrible at first, but as
            time went on, my writing tremendously improved. Poetry led to songwriting, rapping, singing, producing, etc.
            My love for writing, not so much academically, but creatively was what I adored. Although I have never been
            diagnosed with ADHD, I take medications for attention deficit (Clonidine) which has helped I think, but I
            still abhor reading lengthy books. I’ve always preferred short, concise writing like a poem or blog post.
            There’s something with short pieces of work. Not so much depth but a snippet of someone’s life in a
            digestible format. Consistency was always an issue for me, so I never journaled every day and made these
            so-called snippets of daily life. Yet, every time I make a post on social media platforms, I feel like
            that’s our digital journal that we either show to the world or a select few people. With mental health, no
            one knows what is going on inside our heads. This digital journal we portray is so blinded to others that
            even the strongest of people get overlooked for their struggles. Social media impacted my life in negative
            ways with addiction and constant seeking of approval or admiration, but also positively as it grew my
            stature and gained a network that couldn’t have been remotely possible without it. I got the opportunity to
            connect with people from different industries ranging from sports to music. I had an online footprint that
            allowed me to be in contact with people and interest others to my profile. I was always thankful, but also
            recognized the detriments to it. My manic self would create Instagram/Twitter accounts, LinkedIn Company
            pages, buying domains, etc. I would ensure myself that no one could take these ideas. It was almost like I
            felt someone was chasing after me for my ideas. The late nights of ideating ideas that weren’t fully fleshed
            out or what seemed like it was “fleshed out” and overly awful. This sense of grandiosity I had was
            indicative of my bipolar disease. It’s frustrating to acknowledge that I made those mistakes and even got
            made fun of too. I’ve made a ton of mistakes in my life and I’ve grown to understand that mistakes or
            failure are a part of the process. I’m trying and so are you. You shouldn’t feel like you’re dumb because
            it’s just a part of a process. You can be smart in a facet of life that other people might feel dumb in, and
            vice versa. So, don’t feel like you’re dumb, you’re learning. It’s all about a growth mindset, never a fixed
            mindset. I am still growing today learning that I should have a growth mindset and continue to be mindful
            about my thinking. Also, on how to approach my current life and what I should be doing on a daily basis to
            promote growth. It’s all about learning and growing and becoming the better person you were the day before.
            My experience with mental illness allowed me to become more wiser and empathetic with myself and with
            people. By all means, I’m not perfect, but without applying the growth mindset to mental illness you will
            just remain stagnant and be full of despair. Growing up I felt like my mental health was fine, I never felt
            “sick,” but after the passing of my father back in 2010, it made me wonder if that death caused my illness
            to overcome my life or if was it my own fault that triggered it or was it already innate. I never figured
            out the answer to that question even with all the therapy/psychiatry sessions. I’ve never delved into my
            problems deeply enough I feel like. I knew what I had from what smarter or well-educated people on the
            matters decided, but never questioned it or sought answers to the many problems I experienced. It may have
            been due to my depression that made me succumb to sadness and deterred from seeking the truth. Now, I feel
            my mind has been relieved from the struggle due to the medications and additional support from friends,
            which led to the ideation of creating a peer-to-peer support network for musicians like myself. I’ve learned
            being in a scene or a community of other people will make life worth living as a whole. It feels like you’re
            a part of something bigger than life, something that only you and the people you are with can feel on the
            inside. I feel like that’s transformative to a certain extent. The power of feeling a part of something is
            similar to religion, where we practice our beliefs or faith in our daily lives through prayer or reading
            scripture. Being in a community brings forth ideas, support, and joy. To create laughter amongst yourselves
            and feel relieved from the day. That’s the power of community and how mental health can be battled through
            support from others. “A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.” This is
            what I think is important. By being happy-hearted you can immediately feel the benefits. My mom has always
            preached that “You should always fill your mind with good thoughts,” which has played an important role in
            my mindset. My youngest sister, Ruth, has always supported me throughout my mental health journey. Despite
            being a young child she was wise beyond her years. Her continual pieces of wisdom that she gained from her
            life and teachings from church have always inspired me to do better. Her genuine and comforting personality
            has always made me feel at ease and allowed me to have a sibling I could call a close friend. We always
            watched shows and movies together, talked about our lives, asked each other for help, etc. Although we are
            10 years apart, we never felt like our age gap affected our sibling relationship. There are families out
            there who struggle with their relationships and I’ve had them too with my other sister. However, you
            eventually learn that you can’t control what that person thinks about you but rather control what you can
            control. Through controlling your emotions and immersing yourself into the person you want to be. Doing the
            right things, most of the time, but aiming to do the right thing all the time. Healthily penalizing yourself
            is the only way to stimulate growth and ensure you become the person you want to become. Therefore, it is
            through the immersion of ameliorating that leads to our success. Our imperfections are instrumental in
            finding who we are as a person. Every flaw we contain leads to opportunities for advancing ourselves and
            fulfilling our goals, Each step we take in the direction of betterment allows us to become more mature and
            driven to succeed in our obstacles. If I hadn’t taken steps to better my mental health, I wouldn’t have been
            here standing today. I’m not perfect, I’ve made mistakes and still was “lazy” like everyone else, but that’s
            what makes us human. We can intake as much self-help dogma and teachings but continue to do the opposite.
            It’s like our parents banging our heads onto the wall telling us to do “this” or “that.” Life is supposed to
            be imperfect and so are people. They’re not mutually exclusive but coinciding. Mental health is something
            everyone must take care of, mental illness might be when you experience severity with your health mentally
            and need immediate attention, but everyone can get triggered. Physical health is similar, but mental health
            can happen to even the healthiest to the wealthiest of people. You can outrun depression through continual
            exercise, which I’ve been lacking ever since my sports days. Allowing endorphins to fill your mind and
            getting that “natural high” from working out is always good. However, despite that insight, you can’t outrun
            mental illness completely. It’s a never-ending battle that you must be continually fighting daily in your
            life. You may win some days, but you’ll have a fair share of horrible days where you’re on the losing side.
            Everyone has experienced that. The disappointment one must have to feel to realize that they’re losing in
            this battle at times is discouraging. You never know when you’ll win but you keep going ignoring the
            incessant noise that agitates you. I always tell myself to keep going, you’ll lose a lot, there’ll be bad
            days, people will laugh at you, call you names, etc. But you need to ignore them and keep going. This life
            is for you to live and experience for who knows how long. Don’t let a person who knows little about your
            journey dictate who you are and where you’re going in your journey. It’ll take dedication and effort but
            it’s not impossible. You just need to believe in yourself, have faith in your beliefs, and trust that you
            can overcome the challenges that you’ll face. I could’ve died a few times, but someone had other plans for
            me. My mother could have passed away from yellow fever when she was a teenager but there were more plans for
            her. She raised three children through her faith and by working a minimum-wage job. We’ve been given a lot
            of opportunities to succeed in our lives despite the difficulties that arose. My mother was widowed and
            never married or dated another man despite being pestered about it by others. My mom was a rock for me and
            never allowed me to lose hope. We did have a fair share of verbal disagreements, however, that is what you
            call motherly love. Mothers will always try to guide you from their experience, only because they care for
            you, and wish you the best. My mother and I have grown to accept each other and understand each other more,
            strengthening our relationship as a whole. My mother has always continued to give us an environment filled
            with love and care for everything we do, yet some things would have to abide by her personal agendas, my
            sisters and I have attempted to respect them as much as we can. Having lost my father to liver cancer at
            such a young age definitely took a toll on my family, but it is okay. Everything that has happened in our
            lives is just a part of a story of a bigger picture that is in play. We don’t know why they will happen but
            we need to “keep going” regardless. I feel like I can apply that to my music journey. I was doubted and
            laughed at in the beginning. It took a toll on my mental health but I was in love with music. Being able to
            play with an instrument or write a song, I loved it. From looking at photos when I was a toddler, I played
            around with a keyboard made for kids. My mother claimed I enjoyed the sounds of the keyboard and made me
            smile. Now, whenever I play the keyboard, despite being horrendously average, I too enjoy the sounds it
            makes, and being able to share videos on social media of me playing it is enjoyable. I got a guitar in the
            early 2020s, not sure which year exactly to be honest, but I recalled the time my music teacher told me to
            try out the guitar since I was quite good at it in my class. After a couple of months of playing the guitar,
            I was excruciatingly bad at it, but as time went on, I got adequately better but below average. What am I
            trying to say though is that despite being decent at these instruments, I still continued to pursue music
            and write songs or even produce beats. I think all musicians feel the same about their progress, it’s a long
            journey and we may feel like we suck, but we keep going because we love the thrill of it. The ability to
            make a tune that resonates with people; the ability to pour your heart and soul into your art; the
            expression of your heart’s intent in your independent work. Music has that power. Experiencing my illness
            gave me access to my mind to pursue these musical ambitions and make tunes that gravitate towards me. Music
            has that effect on people. Ask any musician and they’ll tell their story. Whether it’s a vocalist, producer
            or songwriter, the various ways in which music appeals to people allows them to experience the art in their
            independent ways. Some musicians experience depression and anxiety (state stat). From speaking to musicians,
            they’ve felt they used their mental health as a way to express themselves in their music. I’m the exact
            same. We use our pain towards our individual art, some may struggle and seek other temporary fulfillment,
            but we all figure out something that resonates with us wholly. My pain led me to make unique art and
            represent who I am as a person. Without my illness, I don’t think I would have been able to create the art
            I’ve made. My manic episodes to depressive episodes cultivated an artistry that was special to me. Although
            my music is not widely listened to, I love the fact I created something on my own and only for me. That’s
            what special about it and shouldn’t be discouraged for others when creating their own art. Both music and
            sports played pivotal parts in my life. Music has already been stated and sports loosely, mostly about the
            demanding nature of the game football. Yet, the anxiety I experienced made me constantly prepare. The
            depression I experienced for underperforming made me realize that I could be better if I prepared better.
            This constant idea of preparation was what lingered in my mind during the depression and anxiety.
            Transferable to music, we’re at a state of continual progression of being better than yesterday, one day at
            a time. I think this is sort of healthy, as we’re constantly evolving, however, it feels almost perpetual.
            We’re always looking to get better, yet most of the time do not have an end goal in sight and as the saying
            goes “there’s always a bigger fish in the pond.” Music and sports will always mean something to me and make
            me grow as a person which I’m thankful of. Reminiscing the bus rides before a football game, the car rides
            to football practice in Guelph when I was playing on their Jr. Gryphons team, the night out with my football
            teammates at Saint Mary’s and the long nights making a beat, writing a song, and recording numerous vocal
            takes. All of these experiences nurtured me. Working hard is something people look up to. People would say I
            work hard, and others would say not so much. There’s a subjectivity I’ve noticed in life. People who don’t
            know you just look at the perceptions or face values while others look at the outcomes. I felt like I was
            always negatively perceived but that depended on the environment I was in. I’ve always struggled with
            communication. I always have to think extremely hard before I say something but still mess up. I’ve always
            envied the silver-tongued folks. Whenever I say something smart or clever, my ego gets fed. I feel relieved
            or euphoric. The same way when I write something creative or witty. Those instances of feeling well about
            yourself are what juiced me up. I think that in itself is an addiction you must be conscious of and let it
            lead you to constantly seek validation from others or even yourself. If you constantly seek validation from
            yourself, you’ll become a perfectionist, which will delay the process of you learning. Perfectionism isn’t
            always the greatest trait. Yes, perhaps it is ensuring you aim for excellence, but what’s the cost of it?
            The cost of it could be extremely detrimental and lead to a lack of growth individually. No one is perfect
            and even with my mental illness, I need to recognize that wholeheartedly. A lack of perfectionism is what
            humans are, we aren’t pristine beings, but rather imperfect ones. I don’t think that’s a bad thing, but
            rather a good thing as we learn to become who we are as a person through our failures and mistakes. We’ll
            find who are destined to be through our independent journeys and allow ourselves to figure us out. It’s a
            natural and organic approach to independent discovery, making human life rather riveting. We will be able to
            discover new things about ourselves and others which will allow us to be unique, which I think is important.
            Being able to be unique and standing out from the crowd is what neurodivergence is, but could be applicable
            to neurotypicals as well if they try to apply that mindset to their daily lives as well. It is through this
            notion that people can change tremendously and learn that imperfection is a part of their growth and not
            just a con about life. It leads to new learnings about living which results to more and novel
            understandings. Everyone has their own struggles that they experience that deter them from achieving their
            goals. The lack of finances, support, illnesses, etc. We all have our disadvantages in our lives and we need
            to deal with the cards we’ve been dealt with. People have lost hope for their goals when they are faced with
            these disadvantages. However, if you just trick your mind into believing that your aspirations or dreams are
            achievable then a snowball effect occurs. You become more attuned and comfortable with doing things that
            seem impossible. People take notice, people ask you questions, and people look up to you. It all starts with
            one act. One move. Similarly, to a chess game, we move our pieces strategically, anticipating a few moves
            ahead to have “some” chance of a win. I say “some” because not everyone wins in life. People have and will
            struggle with their journeys and still not reach where they want to be. It’s not because they didn’t try
            hard enough or didn’t have the resources. It’s simply due to the reaction of society. Society deems to
            decide on whether we should be successful or not. You, me, and others are the consumers or end-users. If we
            don’t garner societal respect from at least a fraction of the global population, how will we succeed? That
            is why the community will always be at the forefront because it’ll lead you out of troubled times. Whether
            it’s mental or physical illnesses, financial burdens, or anything that is stopping you, a sense of community
            that uplifts each other and supports each other is important. You can test-ride communities, get a taste of
            various ones and figure out what resonates with your perspectives and ideologies of existence. Once you find
            a community that works well with you, you’ll be able to have a backbone supporting you through every step.
            This support system will guide you. Even choosing the right people you surround yourself with is vital. Who
            you spend the most time talking to daily will steer you in the right direction in your life. Although my
            family rarely supported my music or sports aspirations, I found my people in music servers, teammates, and
            coaches. You need to seek people who have been in your shoes or similar ones at least to understand the
            grind required to achieve what you want. Your mental health needs it. Community makes mental illness
            bearable. Loneliness, when you are not lonely, is the typical dilemma we currently experience. Personally I
            knew a ton of people but sometimes felt alone. In high school, my mental illness was debilitating. Keeping
            myself away from others in a gym changeroom from others was as isolating as it could get. I got too familiar
            with isolation, I’d grown to enjoy solitude despite my natural extroverted nature that I had back when I was
            a kid up to middle school. I spoke to my sister about this a while ago, to ask if I’m an introvert, and she
            responded no. She mentioned how I’m an extrovert by heart but struggle with underlying issues such as my
            condition. I always assumed, after high school, that I was an introvert. How I preferred solitude rather
            than going out, which is still intact today. Perhaps there are various reasons that coincide with mental
            illness, but I can’t simply give up. One girl I used to talk to reiterated how “I’m not a patient, you’re
            more than that.” That stuck with me. We’re more than patients in this life. We have friends to make memories
            with, families to love regardless, and a life to live our best. The ability to make a lasting impression on
            those we care about and who care about us back. That is the essence of it all. Mental health is simply a
            facet that we must endure, however, we can overcome our mental illness. We can triumph over the scary days
            that come to us, the suicidal ideation that lurks towards us, the darkest days where the future seems so
            bleak. We can overcome that. You need to have faith in the impossible. There is no stopping you tell
            yourself, because you will get out of this rut. You just need to trust you can. Having lost my father at a
            young age due to liver cancer definitely impacted my life. But through my mother and close family friends,
            we were able to survive. I am forever thankful for the people who helped me and gave me guidance in my life
            when it felt like I’d be lost. Despite my mental illness affecting me in my day to day as I grew older, I’ve
            always appreciated the people who showed love. This love was shown through people I’ve met in life like my
            teachers, friends, pastors, teammates, coaches, advisors, and family members. I’ve learned that you can
            always learn something from someone. From their own experiences and mentor you through your journey. I’m
            thankful for everyone and forever will be in debt to the people who strengthened me through my journey. I am
            not only who I am today due to my mental illness but also through the love of people who nurtured me. My
            love continues to love others who have helped me, but it shouldn’t stop only me but for others as well. I
            need to learn that loving only people who are close to you isn’t enough, you must be able to show that care
            to others as well. You never know how much of an impact you can make in the lives of people you meet. It’s
            possible to drastically change people’s lives through your acts. It’s our duty. As Immanuel Kant alludes, it
            is imperative to follow the goodwill of doing good that isn’t self-inclined but rather out of our duty. I
            have to do my part. The more life goes on, the more I learn and acknowledge new things. Such as novel ways
            to battle my mental illness and apply new concepts to my mentality. I try to foster an environment of
            constant learning through social media by following certain people/accounts that bring forth new ideas that
            can be applied. When I discovered stoicism through social media, I grew fascinated with Marcus Aurelius. I
            still haven’t read Meditations yet, but a summarized version. However, I’ve always enjoyed reading quotes by
            him. I wrote a blog post on my site about him in October 2023. It goes like this, “We all love ourselves
            more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.” This quote resonated with me. It is
            rather intrinsic for humanity to care about ourselves more because we are with ourselves more often than
            not. Yet, we care more about the opinions of the opposing individuals that show a lack of thought in our
            day-to-day. Why do continuously allow this to happen to ourselves? Why do we constantly seek other people’s
            approval or validation? Perhaps context matters, such as customer feedback and receiving validation or
            testimonials to show credibility. However, what about minor things like a person judging you based on how
            you look or how you dress or when you answer a question wrong? We’re simply too conscious of what others may
            say or view about us. I still experience this on a daily basis and my bipolar psychosis makes it even more
            difficult to interpret the reality of it. But, I or we shouldn’t have to feel this way. We shouldn’t be
            thinking that what a person says is concrete about us, we dictate that. If I listened to the countless
            number of people who said I shouldn’t have pursued music, I wouldn’t have achieved a minor glimpse of
            success in the field. However, that minor glimpse of success in music allowed me to meet my clients for my
            talent management agency and provide them support with their goals through my own experience. Or when I
            dropped out from Saint Mary’s University when I overdosed on my antidepressants and started my startup
            journey. This led to meeting my friend Kevin (Yi Han) who I started a duo and created a song that got
            featured on Canadian Beats, PopCanRadio, and stellar reviews from a YouTuber and TikToker. This all wouldn’t
            have been possible if I listened to someone about “What not to do” and do the more practical thing. Of
            course, the situation matters more often than not. If I had a child or wife then I feel like I’m obligated
            to focus on that, but I wasn’t, I’m still young. I’m 24 writing this at the moment and about to turn 25 in
            less than 2 weeks, but I feel empowered to continue to try and ignore advice from others but take them into
            consideration when assessing my future decisions. If all the people who became successful in life took
            advice to quit or be risk-averse, they wouldn’t be great themselves. You have to take risks, obviously not
            lethal or idiotic ones, but risks that will take you to a place of thrills and unconquered grounds. It’s
            revitalizing for your mental health, as you’ll meet new people, learn from them and innately adapt.
            Struggling with an inflammatory bowel disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and an identified kidney
            stone are all things I have to face. Other people have pressing issues that they have to face in life as
            well. All these issues that we face intrinsically cultivate who we are. We can either let it be stamped on
            our foreheads or acknowledge these challenges and keep fighting. That’s all we can do. Keep fighting despite
            what we face, because there is hope. We can do something with our lives, we can make a difference, and we
            can do the impossible or the unlikely. We can change the narrative by shifting our mindset through daily
            practice. There will be down days and up days, don’t get me wrong. But, we need to go against the wind,
            against the opposing figures in our lives. I can’t let my mental and physical conditions win, I can control
            what I can control and let God handle the rest. My conditions made me truly understand that you can’t take
            life for granted. Good health is something that you should always prioritize. I still find myself lacking in
            every aspect of my health, which I’m disappointed with. The “I used to be…” this and that doesn’t hold up
            anymore. I know it’s mainly due to my medication which caused me to gain immense weight, but I need to try.
            I need to try to work on my health by doing the necessary fitness regimens, eating a well-balanced diet, and
            doing various things that are required for me to do. I am not a perfect being is what I tell myself. I may
            be lacking in certain facets, but I shouldn’t let it define who I am. I am more than a figure I say in a
            mirror or what people view me as. Rather, I should be strengthened by the fact I look like this. I fought
            battles in my life and I survived. I may not be where I want to be, but I am not a loser; I am a warrior.
            It’ll take time for me to heal and that’s understandable, it might even take a lifetime, who knows. But, as
            long as I know I have people who love me dearly and care about me, I am winning. As long I have a sane mind,
            I am winning. As long as I have food to eat, clothes to wear, a house to live in, etc. I AM WINNING. And
            that’s all to it. Nothing more or less. Tell yourself that you’ll keep winning and marvelous things will
            occur to you. Every practical loss is a lesson that can be applied to your learnings of life. So take heed
            and embark on a journey of persistence and proving the neurotypicals wrong. You will WIN. “Just do it.”</p>
