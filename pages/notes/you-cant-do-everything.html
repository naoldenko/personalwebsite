        <p>Humbling epiphany...</p>

        <p>You can't do everything!</p>
        
        <p>So, focus on your roots and what you're intrinsically inclined to do.</p>
        
        <p>Whether it's music, biology, tech, sports, etc.</p>
        
        <p>Find that "thing" or few "things" that define your existence or purpose, and let it be your North Star.</p>
        
        <p>You can always change, but as long as you're inclined and willing to adjust, there will be no issue.</p>
        
        <p>Incorporating or mixing facets of your purpose into your work or life makes everything feel fulfilling, but do not aim to achieve everything on this Earth.</p>
        
        <p>Be a generalized specialist; have three broad, overarching umbrellas of your natural inclinations and go in-depth within each of them to achieve satisfaction.</p>
        
        <p>You can't spend every day doing "everything"; keep it focused.</p>
        
        <p>Focus = Happiness</p>
