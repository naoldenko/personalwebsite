    <h3>March 2025</h3>
    <div id="text">
        <p>Social media brought access to a wide variety of stories from people you wouldn't hear from on a day-to-day basis that would've been untold if it wasn't for this channel.</p>

        <p>A whole pot of various personalities that share their defeats and triumphs.</p>
        
        <p>There are obviously detriments to social media (e.g., its addicting nature). However, it's eye-opening to hear stories or connect with others in this realm.</p>
        
        <p>Powerful, but dangerous at the same time.</p>
        
        <p>Be cautious but be open.</p>
